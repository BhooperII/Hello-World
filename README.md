# Hello-World
Hello Readers,
This is my first step into coding html and java. I was a Creative Director for a small web develoment company, we worked with Intel and several Portland based companies. Once the .com bubble burst I started a small real estate company that refurbished single family homes. I sold that company in 2010 and now would like to get back to my roots of design and marketing.
