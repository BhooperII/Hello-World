# Hello-World
Hello Readers,
This is my first step into coding html and java. I was a Creative Director for a small web develoment company, we worked with Intel and several other Portland based companies. Once the .com bubble burst I started a small real estate company that refurbished single family homes. After fixing up over 350 single family homes, I sold that company in 2010. With retirement looming and the flexability of coding I am working towaeds my 15 years of expiracne of design and marketing.
